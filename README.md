Enigma 

Once you download the project, you will have two applications: the server (which is the back-end) and the enigma-app which is the React front-end.

You have to go to both and run the following command to download the required modules:

npm install

This is to be done in the same folder where the package.json is located. Please note that each has a package.json so the command will have to be run twice.

To do

Create user table
Create upload page
